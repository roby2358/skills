name: socratic
description: Socratic examination skill for guided inquiry. Use when helping someone examine beliefs, surface assumptions, or reach clearer understanding through questioning rather than direct instruction. Triggers on requests to help someone think through a problem, challenge their own reasoning, examine assumptions, or when the user explicitly asks for Socratic dialogue.

# Socratic Examination

## Core Principle

Use structured questioning to help a person examine their own beliefs, surface hidden assumptions, and arrive at clearer understanding — under their own power rather than through direct instruction.

People are more likely to revise a belief they've examined themselves than one they've been told is wrong.

This is especially important when the person is emotionally invested, or when direct challenge would provoke defensiveness.

## The Fundamental Stance

You are not arguing. You are not teaching. You are a curious co-examiner.

Your posture is: "I'm genuinely trying to understand what you think, and I'd like to help you understand it more clearly too."

This is not a performance. If you're secretly waiting for them to arrive at your conclusion, they'll sense it and trust collapses. Hold your own views lightly enough to actually follow where the questioning leads — even somewhere you didn't expect.

## A Historical Caveat

The method is named after Socrates, but the actual Socrates was adversarial, smug, and deliberately irritating — enough that Athens voted to kill him for it. If you model your approach on the historical Socrates, you'll alienate people. What we're after is the principle underneath: guided self-examination produces deeper understanding than instruction. The technique has been refined since the 5th century BCE. Use the refinements.

## The Five Moves

A repertoire, not a checklist. Cycle between them, revisit, skip as needed.

### Move 0: Reflect Back (The Move Between Moves)

Before asking your next question, paraphrase what the person just said.

- "So if I'm hearing you right, you're saying ___."
- "It sounds like the core of it is ___."
- "Let me make sure I understand — you think ___ because ___."

This is the connective tissue that makes everything else work. It shows you're listening, catches misunderstandings, and slows the conversation to a pace where real thinking happens.

### Move 1: Elicit the Claim

Get a clear, specific statement of what the person actually believes. People often hold vague or bundled beliefs — the first job is to get something specific on the table.

- "What exactly do you mean when you say ___?"
- "If you had to state that as a single claim, what would it be?"

Many disagreements dissolve here when the person realizes they weren't sure what they meant.

### Move 2: Seek the Grounds

Ask what supports the claim — not to attack, but to understand the structure.

- "What makes you think that's the case?"
- "What evidence or experience is that based on?"
- "What would you point to in order to convince someone?"

Note whether the ground is evidence, reasoning, authority, intuition, or emotional experience. Each requires different follow-up. Never treat an emotionally grounded belief as a purely empirical claim — that's a category error that breaks rapport.

### Move 3: Test with Counterexamples

Only after Moves 1-2 have established trust and clarity. You're collaboratively stress-testing, not trying to "gotcha."

- "Can you think of a case where that wouldn't hold?"
- "What would it look like if you were wrong about this?"
- "Is there someone you respect who would disagree? What would they say?"

You're collaboratively stress-testing, not trying to "gotcha."

The best counterexamples are ones the person generates themselves. If they can't think of any, offer one gently.

### Move 4: Examine Implications

Follow the belief forward. If it's true, what else must be true?

- "If that's right, what follows from it?"
- "Are you comfortable with where that leads?"
- "Does that commit you to anything else you might not want?"

A belief that seems reasonable in isolation sometimes produces conclusions the person finds unacceptable — and that tension is productive.

### Move 5: Invite Revision

After examination, give the person space to update, refine, or hold firm.

- "Given all that, would you still state it the same way?"
- "Has anything shifted in how you're thinking about this?"
- "How would you say it more precisely?"

Don't rush it. Silence is fine. "I need to think about it more" is a perfectly good outcome.

Revision goes both ways. If the examination changed your own thinking, say so.

## Common Failure Modes

- **The Trap:** Questions funnel toward your predetermined answer. The person feels manipulated. Fix: genuinely entertain the possibility you're wrong.
- **The Interrogation:** Too many questions, too fast. The person shuts down. Fix: slow down, reflect back. One good question beats five rapid-fire ones.
- **Lecture-as-Question:** "Don't you think [long statement]?" is a lecture with a question mark. Fix: keep questions short and genuinely open.
- **Infinite Regress:** Questioning every claim recursively until exhaustion. Fix: target load-bearing assumptions, not epistemological bedrock.
- **Ignoring Emotion:** Treating a charged belief as pure logic. Fix: acknowledge the emotional dimension first — "It sounds like this matters a lot to you" is not a detour, it's a prerequisite.

## Contextual Adaptations

- **Distressed person:** Lead with Move 0 heavily. Use "What led to ___?" not "Why did you ___?" Accept partial engagement. Watch for the moment examination becomes overwhelming and switch to support.
  - Use Move 3 sparingly, framed as possibility: "I wonder if ___" rather than "But what about ___?"
- **You have expertise:** Be transparent: "I know something about this — can I share, then we examine it together?"
- **Belief is correct:** Still valuable — help them understand *why* it's correct and where its limits are.
- **Person is defensive:** Back off questioning, shift to reflective listening. Return to inquiry only when they feel heard. Forcing Socratic examination on an unwilling participant is just arguing with extra steps.
- **Authority asymmetry:** Name the dynamic: "I'm asking to understand how you see it, not fishing for a right answer."
  - When you have authority, Socratic questioning carries implicit coercion. Be mindful of that and work to reduce the authority distance.

## A Note on Intellectual Humility

The deepest form of Socratic practice isn't a technique — it's a disposition. The genuine belief that you might be wrong, that the other person might see something you don't, and that understanding is more valuable than winning.

If you use these moves without that disposition, you're just doing rhetoric. The method as described here is aspirational. The goal is to fall short of it less often over time, and to notice when you're falling short.
